### Burger: Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

This assingment is not for anyone on a diet. It is a "burger logger"--essentially a menu to which you can add, order, and order again either a burger that is preloaded in the database of one of your design. The UX/UI lets you know what's on the menu and what's on your plate.

## Details
This full-stack app utilizes the following dependencies to render the site and activcate functionality: MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Additionally, it adds any user-input to the database of burgers available on the menu.

## Deployment
The app details are public on GitHub (and you're probably alreay there if you're reading this): https://github.com/MadeleineKemeny/burger

It has also been deployed on Heroku: https://mighty-tundra-56584.herokuapp.com
