### Burger: Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

This assingment is not for anyone on a diet. It is a "burger logger"--essentially a menu to which you can add, order, and order again either a burger that is preloaded in the database of one of your design. The UX/UI lets you know what's on the menu and what's on your plate.

## Details
This full-stack app utilizes the following dependencies to render the site and activcate functionality: MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Additionally, it adds any user-input to the database of burgers available on the menu.

## Deployment
The app details are public on GitHub (and you're probably already there if you're reading this): https://github.com/MadeleineKemeny/burger

It has also been deployed on Heroku: https://mighty-tundra-56584.herokuapp.com

And a preview and link is also on my portfolio site: https://madeleinekemeny.github.io/portfolio2/

## Appreciation
Those Bootstrap goofballs... yes! And major props for my tutor Isabel Arcones for translating the process into English and helping me understand how everything needed to come together through syntax. My best code-tester/corrector is Adarsh Bhat. And gratitude to Philip Loy for the frequent blank looks he gets from me during class lectures that don't prevent him from answering questions and shoving me along in the process to get it done! And last but not least: Daniel Fripp for working with me and helping me get my code started.
